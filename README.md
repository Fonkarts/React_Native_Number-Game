# React_Native_Tasks-App

Here's a simple React Native Game that consists in guessing a number.

## Installation

Make sure that you have Node + npm installed on your system.

Then clone this repo, open a terminal, go to your folder,
and execute the following

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash

# run the app
expo start

# run the app on Android
expo start --android

# run the app on IOS
expo start --ios

# run the app on the Web
expo start --web
```

You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go App if you want to check your changes on a real phone.
Or you can start an emulator such as Android Studio's.
